## Introduction

StudyNotion is a mission-driven platform, dedicated to enhancing accessibility and engagement in education. It serves as a global stage for instructors to showcase expertise and connect with learners, fostering a vibrant community of knowledge exchange.

This documentation delves into the technical intricacies, covering system architecture, API design, installation guidelines, usage instructions, and future enhancement possibilities.

## System Architecture

The StudyNotion EdTech platform comprises three core elements: the front-end, the back-end, and the database. The platform adopts a client-server architecture, with the front-end acting as the client and the back-end and database as the server.

### Front-end

Built on ReactJS, the front-end ensures a dynamic and responsive user interfaceâ€”a cornerstone for an engaging learning experience. Seamless communication with the back-end is achieved through RESTful API calls.

#### Front End Pages

**For Students:**

- **Homepage:** Introduction to the platform with links to the course list and user details.
- **Course List:** Comprehensive list of available courses with descriptions and ratings.
- **Wishlist:** Displays courses added to a student's wishlist.
- **Cart Checkout:** Facilitates course purchases.
- **Course Content:** Presents course content, including videos and related material.
- **User Details:** Displays account details.
- **User Edit Details:** Allows students to edit account details.

**For Instructors:**

- **Dashboard:** Overview of the instructor's courses, along with ratings and feedback.
- **Insights:** Detailed metrics for instructor's courses, such as views and clicks.
- **Course Management Pages:** Facilitates course creation, updates, and deletion, along with content and pricing management.
- **View and Edit Profile Details:** Allows instructors to manage account details.

#### Front-end Tools and Libraries

The front-end employs ReactJS, CSS, and Tailwind for styling, with state management handled by Redux.

### Back-end

The back-end of the platform is built using NodeJS and ExpressJS, providing APIs for the front-end to consume. These APIs include functionalities such as user authentication, course creation, and course consumption. The back-end also handles the logic for processing and storing the course content and user data.

#### Back-end Features

- **User Authentication and Authorization:** Students and instructors can sign up and log in to the platform using their email addresses and passwords. The platform also supports OTP (One-Time Password) verification and forgot password functionality for added security.
- **Course Management:** Instructors can create, read, update, and delete courses, as well as manage course content and media. Students can view and rate courses.
- **Payment Integration:** Students will purchase and enroll in courses by completing the checkout flow, followed by Razorpay integration for payment handling.
- **Cloud-based Media Management:** StudyNotion uses Cloudinary, a cloud-based media management service, to store and manage all media content, including images, videos, and documents.
- **Markdown Formatting:** Course content in document format is stored in Markdown format, allowing for easier display and rendering on the front-end.

#### Back-end Frameworks, Libraries, and Tools

The back-end of StudyNotion uses various frameworks, libraries, and tools to ensure its functionality and performance, including:

- **Node.js:** Used as the primary framework for the back-end.
- **Express.js:** Used as a web application framework, providing a range of features and tools for building web applications.
- **MongoDB:** Used as the primary database, providing a flexible and scalable data storage solution.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** Used for authentication and authorization, providing a secure and reliable way to manage user credentials.
- **Bcrypt:** Used for password hashing, adding an extra layer of security to user data.
- **Mongoose:** Used as an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library, providing a way to interact with MongoDB using JavaScript.

#### Data Models and Database Schema

The back-end of StudyNotion uses several data models and database schemas to manage data, including:

- **Student Schema:** Includes fields such as name, email, password, and course details for each student.
- **Instructor Schema:** Includes fields such as name, email, password, and course details for each instructor.
- **Course Schema:** Includes fields such as course name, description, instructor details, and media content.

### Database

The database for the platform is built using MongoDB, a NoSQL database that provides a flexible and scalable data storage solution. MongoDB allows for the storage of unstructured and semi-structured data. The database stores the course content, user data, and other relevant information related to the platform.
